In terminal use the javac command to compile Game.java, then to run just call java Game

One assumption is that when moving a piece, 4 numbers are entered with spaces in between them
like: (4 0 3 0), no spaces in the beginning or end. Another assumption will be that when promoting
a pawn and being asked to enter the piece it should be promoted to, it will be entered with the first
letter capital like: "Queen" or "Knight" or "Rook"

No known bugs or defects in the program

No outside sources
